# Wheat_Detection
accurate wheat head detection in outdoor field images can be visually challenging. There is often overlap of dense wheat plants, and the wind can blur the photographs. Both make it difficult to identify single heads. Additionally, appearances vary due to maturity, color, genotype, and head orientation. Finally, because wheat is grown worldwide, different varieties, planting densities, patterns, and field conditions must be considered. Models developed for wheat phenotyping need to generalize between different growing environments. Current detection methods involve one- and two-stage detectors (Yolo-V3 and Faster-RCNN), but even when trained with a large dataset, a bias to the training region remains.
